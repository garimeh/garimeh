# Hello, fellow programmers! 👋

I am an amateur developer with skills in C++, Python, Machine Learning/ Artificial Intelligence, Large Language Models, Javascript, Pygame, and working on myself to adapt to more technologies. My activities are much beyond my stream of education. ⚡ I am involved in a lot of *organizational works* in college related to clubs, fests and workshops and helped in building many communities from scratch.
